        <p class="fade-text">Every night I drown in silent tears, yet you never notice...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I whisper 'I love you' into the void, hoping you'll hear...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">My heart shatters every time you walk away without a word...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I wish I could turn back time to a moment when you cared...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Even in pain, I still choose to love you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">No matter how much I try, I remain invisible to your heart...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">The silence between us speaks louder than any words ever could...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I hold onto memories because they are all I have left of you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">My love for you is like a candle in the storm, struggling to stay alight...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I wonder if you ever feel a fraction of what I feel for you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I keep rereading our old messages, hoping to feel close to you again...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I watch you smile at others while my heart breaks in silence...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">The pain of missing you is greater than the joy of loving you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I pretend to be okay, but inside, I'm falling apart...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">No matter how far you go, my heart will always wait for you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">You became my world, and now my world feels empty without you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">If love is a battle, then I'm fighting alone...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">My love is a silent scream, unheard and unnoticed...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I gave you my heart, and you left it in pieces...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I am drowning in my own emotions, while you float away untouched...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I loved you beyond words, but you never looked deep enough to see it...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">You were my reason to smile, now you're the reason for my tears...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I wish you could step into my heart to feel the storm you left behind...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I never knew loving someone could hurt this much...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">You walked away, but my heart still follows you...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">You taught me love, and then you taught me pain...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">You became a stranger with all my secrets...</p>
